# 🚚 Shipping War  

Shipping War is a **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** web application inspired by the concept of competitive shipment bidding.  
It allows **drivers (truckers)** to bid on shipments, track delivery progress, and manage logistics — while admins can manage shipments and assign drivers.
